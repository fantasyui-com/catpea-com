     "Don&apos;t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one&apos;s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one&apos;s surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it. I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long-run - in the long-run, I say! - success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think about it."

     "A truly brave man is ever serene; he is never taken by surprise; nothing ruffles the equanimity of his spirit. In the heat of battle he remains cool; in the midst of catastrophes he keeps level his mind. Earthquakes do not shake him, he laughs at storms. We admire him as truly great, who, in the menacing presence of danger or death, retains his self-possession; who, for instance, can compose a poem under impending peril or hum a strain in the face of death. Such indulgence betraying no tremor in the writing or in the voice, is taken as an infallible index of a large nature - of what we call a capacious mind, which, far from being pressed or crowded, has always room for something more."

     "<h5>Righteousness</h5> <p>Be acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.</p> <h5>Heroic Courage</h5> <p>Hiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.</p> <h5>Benevolence, Compassion</h5> <p>Through intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.</p> <h5>Respect</h5> <p>True warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.</p> <h5>Integrity</h5> <p>When warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to &#x2018;give their word&#x2019;. They do not have to &#x2018;promise&#x2019;. Speaking and doing are the same action.</p> <h5>Honour</h5> <p>Warriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of whom they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.</p> <h5>Duty and Loyalty</h5> <p>Warriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said, and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.</p> <h5>Self-Control</h5> <p>Warriors feel more than others. This calmness of behavior and composure of mind is rooted in the choice of endurance without a groan, wisdom over ignorance, understanding over confrontation, love over anger, and unbreakability in the face of suffering and loneliness.</p>"

Even the smallest adjustment in a question, such as the article preceding the supposed memory, could alter the responses. For example, having asked someone if they&apos;d seen &quot;the&quot; stop sign, rather than &quot;a&quot; stop sign, provided the respondent with a presupposition that there was a stop sign in the scene. This presupposition increased the number of people responding that they had indeed seen the stop sign. </p> <p> Visit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory\">False Memory</a> for more. </p>"

     "<p> Misconception: The words &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot; must not begin a sentence. Those who impose this rule on themselves are following a modern English &quot;rule&quot; that was not used historically. Jeremy Butterfield described this perceived prohibition as one of &quot;the folk commandments of English usage&quot;. The Chicago Manual of Style says: There is a widespread belief&#x2014;one with no historical or grammatical foundation&#x2014;that it is an error to begin a sentence with a conjunction such as &apos;and&apos;, &apos;but&apos;, or &apos;so&apos;. In fact, a substantial percentage (often as many as 10 percent) of the sentences in first-rate writing begin with conjunctions. It has been so for centuries, and even the most conservative grammarians have followed this practice. </p> <p> And you can visit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_English_usage_misconceptions\">Common English usage misconceptions</a> for more. </p>"

I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms..."

     "<p>The staying in the moment that he describes can be induced with a fun and snappy playlist, where non-stop endurance bodybuilding is concerned. I don&#x2019;t mean to trivialize what he is describing, ultramarathons are different from endurance workouts, they take longer and you certainly don&#x2019;t want to depend on your mp3 player to finish. At the same time ultramarathons have relative silence and it is easier to focus in the middle of an interesting run, or pretty dessert; than a gym. I would add that during my jogging days I had success with &#x201C;separating&#x201D; my mind from my body, by thinking of my body as a good horse, that will serve well as long as it is treated well.</p>"

     "<p> Creating sounds with a synthesizer can be tiring, not every sound you synthesize will be ground breaking. Back in the old days, listeners were not too happy with synthesized songs, people would actually call them UFO Sounds. </p> <p> Some choose to skip sound synthesis and create/<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Drumkits/\">download</a> samples. Samples can be replayed at different frequencies, depending on which piano key you hit. In fact if you record a single piano key, you can almost recreate the piano entirely by replaying that one piano key at different frequencies/notes (A note like <em>middle C</em>, is just a named frequency, in this case 261.63 Hz.) </p> <p> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)\">Sampling</a> is the art of borrowing a sound, or even a little bit of a song (as in Lofi Hip Hop) and frequently replaying it at a different frequency. You can also sample sounds around you to create unique drums, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi-hat\">hats</a>, even piano or some lo-tech violin out of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zS4gZcjSHk4\">flinging a doorstop</a>. You can give beatboxing a try and build a song out of sampling/splicing the instruments you imitated with your own voice. </p> <p> Downloadable Drumkits, are collections of short samples of instruments taken from various places, including other songs. Visit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Drumkits/\">r/Drumkits</a> for some free downloads. </p> <p> Additionally, <a href=\"https://freesound.org/\">freesound</a> has a huge library, and <a href=\"https://splice.com/\">Splice</a> has a well organized one aimed at musicians for $7.99/mo (the free trial is worth it). </p>"

The demoscene is an international computer art subculture focused on producing demos: self-contained, sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audio-visual presentations. The purpose of a demo is to show off programming, visual art, and musical skills. Demos and other demoscene productions are shared at festivals known as demoparties, voted on by those who attend, and released online.

To log into her dad&#x2019;s computer she uses the ssh command. ssh is just a program that establishes a secure (encrypted) connection between two computers.

     "<p>Now, when the Little Hacker Lady, logs into her dad&#x2019;s computer she makes it talk using the <strong>say</strong> command.</p> <p>A command is a feature of the Operating System, using commands is a management or administrative task, it is not really true programming, but it is OK to call it that.</p> <p>The say command uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis\">speech synthesis</a> to convert text to speech. The say command resides on her dad&#x2019;s computer, and thus uses her dad&#x2019;s speaker. She executes the command at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=310\">5:10</a></p> <p>The command she executes is wonderfully illustrative:</p> <p><strong>say -v serena dad watch out</strong></p> <p>You see that <span class=\"strong\">-v</span> that&#x2019;s a special directive that states when executing the say command use the <span class=\"strong\">v</span>oice of serena, serena is a cute name for a library of sounds, the say command supports multiple voices, serena is one of them.</p> <p>How do people know that <span class=\"strong\">-v</span> means voice, and how do they know that serena is one of the voices? <strong>Nobody knows this at first</strong>, before a person executes a command they read about it in a manual. The manual command is called <span class=\"strong\">man</span> and people usually type <span class=\"strong\">man</span> followed by the command-name that they want to learn about. In this case: <span class=\"strong\">man say</span> (meaning bring up the manual page for the say command). The man page will tell you how you can list all the available voices too (<span class=\"strong\">say -v=?</span>), a command like <span class=\"strong\">say</span> can do multiple things based on what you are trying to do. Here is the internet version of a man page for say: <a href=\"https://ss64.com/osx/say.html\">https://ss64.com/osx/say.html</a></p> <p>People are not happy with this. Many try to create simplified man pages, here is one example <a href=\"https://tldr.sh/\">https://tldr.sh/</a> but it is always best to go to the source, and just get used to the man command.</p> <p>She didn&#x2019;t need to use the serena voice library, she could have just executed:</p> <p> <strong>say dad watch out </strong></p> <p>And the say command would use the default voice. The say command is mostly available on Macs, Raspberry Pi will likely use the <span class=\"strong\">espeak</span> command.</p> <p> <strong>espeak &quot;dad watch out&quot; </strong></p> <p>Espeak command is slightly different, for it gets confused by multiple words, you have to join them together by wrapping them in quotes. A programmer should demand that his program code has good hygiene. eSpeak simply said &#x201C;I am not just going to read everything that you type at me&#x201D; whereas the programmer that made the say command said &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s just assume that whatever they throw at us needs to be converted to speech unless something starts with a hyphen&#x201D;. The say command makes assumptions, whereas espeak is very strict about input.</p>"

Mac users frequently use <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a> code editor. She issues the <span class=\"strong\">kill</span> command with the <span class=\"strong\">-9</span> switch, this is a terrible idea, as it basically crashes her dad&#x2019;s code editor and the <span class=\"strong\">-9</span> ensures there is no way to save data. Here is the man page for the kill command <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill\">https://linux.die.net/man/1/kill</a>. Unix programs that are actively running are called processes (as in a program that is processing something) and each process has a number. The kill command can be used during development and debugging, in a reboot scenario, or when battery is about to die on a laptop, it has its proper uses. As a joke, it is already bad enough to use the kill command on a process as it sends a TERM[inate] signal. As a programmer you can add a signal handler in your program, and then in case of TERM signal you can for example ask the user to save his data, the TERM signal is an advisory. The -9 sends a KILL signal. There is no handler for the KILL signal, there is no saving work, the process is destroyed by the Operating System, whatever he was working on is lost. She executes <span class=\"strong\">kill -9 95251</span> at <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W76o_iG7Y7g?t=326\">5:26</a> his code editor disappears instantly. <strong>Yikes!</strong></p>"

The members of this culture originated the term &#x2018;hacker&#x2019;. Hackers built the Internet. Hackers made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you a hacker, you&#x2019;re a hacker.</p> <p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture. There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics or music &#x2014; actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and may call them &#x2018;hackers&#x2019; too &#x2014; and some claim that the hacker nature is really independent of the particular medium the hacker works in.</p> <p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but aren&#x2019;t. These are people (mainly adolescent males, and little girls) who get a kick out of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers call these people &#x2018;crackers&#x2019; and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and object that being able to break security doesn&#x2019;t make you a hacker any more than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word &#x2018;hacker&#x2019; to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no end.</p> <p>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.&#x201D;</p>"

I don&apos;t recommend you use this command, unless you familiarize yourself with their Terms of Service, specifics of downloading content with third-party tools, and own the content yourself. Note that it is not just a YouTube account that may get suspended, but all the rest too, gmail and google docs, stuff on your android phone, etc. </p> <p> Here is what the command would look for a YouTube Creator hoping to make a backup of a particular video. </p> <p>youtube-dl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID</p> <p> And here is the code for saving just the audio it self, this is useful for making an audio only version of an adventure video or remixing your content in a song. </p> <p>youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID</p> <p> Look how simple and easy to read.

Our team is on the lookout for skilled, passionate designers and developers we can work with to create amazing themes for the Theme Store.</p> <h5 id=\"important-info\" class=\"js-waypoint\">Important information to know before you apply</h5> <p>Here are a few things to consider before you send us your Theme Partner application:</p> <ul class=\"bulleted-list\"> <li>Shopify themes need constant care and attention. We expect Theme Partners who work with us to be engaged, passionate about their theme(s), and apply any theme updates we request in a timely manner. </li> <li>Being a Theme Partner is a full-time job. You will need to dedicate a lot of time updating your theme(s) as well as supporting the merchants who are using your theme. If you become a Theme Partner, you&#x2019;ll need to consider how you&#x2019;ll balance Theme Partner work with other jobs you are currently doing, or are planning to be engaged in. </li> <li>Our current Theme Partners are a tight-knit group of people. We expect potential Theme Partners to be approachable and collaborative with the Shopify Theme Partnerships team, as well as merchants using your theme(s). </li> <li>We want Theme Partners to actively contribute to the Shopify themes ecosystem, and work with us to help merchants succeed. The Theme Partnerships team will be working closely with you every step of the way during the theme submission process, and will continue to work closely with you once your theme is published. We have dedicated email and Slack channels set up to provide feedback, advice and support for all your theme-related questions and issues. </li> <li>The revenue share for Theme Partners is 70/30.

Please do not distribute your theme on other marketplaces or third-party channels, or try to take customers away from the Theme Store. </p> <h5 id=\"support\" class=\"js-waypoint\">Theme support</h5> <p>If there is a technical issue with your theme (for example: broken layout, dead link, logic error) you will be responsible for fixing the issue in a timely fashion. Critical bugs must be fixed immediately or your theme may be temporarily removed from the Theme Store.</p> <p>Theme Partners are responsible for supporting merchants who use their theme(s). You will need to provide a public support email address, theme documentation, and assist merchants with their theme-related questions. </p> <p>Themes will be removed from the Theme Store if they have made less than 25 sales in a 3 month time period. Theme Partners are responsible for keeping their themes up-to-date with core Shopify features and any improved standards Shopify implements in the future. These can include improvements to the overall user experience, the user interface, accessibility, and more.</p>"

     "<p> Now, a job making themes for Shopify is great for a Web Design start-up struggling to get customers, as 160 sales would get them $20K, after the 30% cut (of $8,640). But for an outsider looking in, it is just a look into the world of professional web development, and never-ending bug fixing. Aside from regular bugs, both code-bases (bootstrap and shopify) are under active development, that is a lot of code updates. </p> <p> There is a smaller but streamlined theme sales platform, with <a href=\"https://support.wrapbootstrap.com/help/submission-guidelines-themes-and-templates\">more reasonable restrictions</a>. Take a look at the sales stats that they parade right at their <a href=\"https://wrapbootstrap.com/\">front page</a>. At 48,623 sales priced at $44 USD, the <a href=\"https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S\">INSPINIA - Responsive Admin Theme</a> would have made 2.2 million USD. Even if WrapBootstrap took 50% of that, the developer took a million home. </p> <p> Now remember <a href=\"https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S\">INSPINIA</a> is sitting right on top of <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> so <a href=\"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pulse\">all this development is going on in the back</a> at no charge to <a href=\"https://wrapbootstrap.com/user/WebAppLayers\">INSPINIA Developers</a>. All they do is add more components, and keep up with the latest updates to the <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> code base. </p>"

In other words, a Founder, a CEO. </p> <p> You shouldn&apos;t think of a web developer as a person that merely develops for the web, think of one as a developer of the web.
