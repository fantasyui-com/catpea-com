Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty One,
I've been programming all day, but now I am done.

I coded colors, design, music, a whole ballad,
but now my mind has fixed its aims on a salad.

I've been trying to invent one that tastes really nice,
one that someone could even eat twice.

And I did! as I always do,
Just add Strawberry Jam, a dollop or two.

No need for dressing,
it tastes like a blessing!

Just squirt some jam,
mix it up and bam!
