Iron Horse

Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Two,
I thought about my bicycle, my trail,
the morning dew.

When there is no gym,
I get up real early,
and ride on through,

It is magical out there,
seeing the world from the other side,
people stuck in traffic,
and here I ride.

I discovered modern architecture
of the highway underpass,
little woodland parks,
endless fields of grass.

Five miles out,
there lives an angry goose,

at seven miles,
in deep summer, angry 'squitoes on the loose,

Ten miles out,
there is a ninety degree turn,
and emptiness follows,
nothing but deep green fern.

Fifteen miles out,
a whole new city,
two new parks,
and the road gets gritty.

At twenty miles,
the real adventure starts,
you better have water,
and some street smarts.

And if you keep going forward,
you'll arrive on a pier at Lake Erie.

At first you'll feel pretty weary,
until you realize you're 30 miles from your bed,
at which point things will get pretty mad.

Hope you have trailmix.
Cause you're gonna need it.
To find you way back.
and keep pushing those pedals.

It will get dark soon,
but upon your return,
you'll fall into your comfy bed,
with a long, dramatic swoon,
