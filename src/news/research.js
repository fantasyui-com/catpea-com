      [Designer] is working out. The tool was needed because of how many tiny adjustments are required to make faux 3D out of mere shadows.

      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/button.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="A button in the wild."> <figcaption class="figure-caption">A button in the wild.</figcaption> </figure>

      [Designer] generates ready to go CSS code but that is not what [Bootstrap Themes] will want, I have to generate special code that integrates with their color system.

      Further more, the button shown above is too big, to anomalous, and can only be used for special occasions.

      But, I still need to style default bootstrap buttons.

      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/bb.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Default Bootstrap Buttons"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Default Bootstrap Buttons</figcaption> </figure>

      So, I have to be a lot more delicate with my design, making only tiny subtle changes. And then the raised 3D button I created are treated as Bonus Extras.

      More than writing code, I need to tap into Bootstrap's Module System, their standard library. I need to create a Bootstrap Extended Library, and the functions contained there in, will be injected into Bootstrap's own buttons.

      INJECTION IS SIMPLE, in a world where I am dealing with a static program, this is not this world. I am dealing with up to 10 versions of bootstrap ([Bootstrap Versions]), so all code modifications on my end must be automated [serserge] will take care of it, entirely.

      Having said that, that is is about a two year long project, realistically, I may have some neat things, in a few days, but I have to begin programming, for a Team of Developers. I need to put on my manager hat, and begin preparing this Theme project for multiple programmers to help me finish.

      This is pretty fun, it is cool.

      There is a program called WordPress, they are like a blogging platform. And they support WordPress Themes.

      What I need to do, is create a Bootstrap Theme, in such a way, that somebody can plug in my Bootstrap Theme into their own Bootstrap Based WordPress Theme, and it will just work.

      It is a lot constraint, restriction, and direction. But pretty fun as well.

      So with this post I will launch a third blog (in addition to Poetry and Research) and begin musing about Theme Development. I would like this blog section to be bundled with the theme (or along side it) as a kind of a proof of development, and quality.

      I just finished another upgrade for [Designer] and it can make Ice Cream now. I also made a couple of Profiles (Lemon and Blueberry) to toggle between and the transition is animated.

      This tool should be enough to begin with interesting UI Themes.

      Just to remind, my aim is a product on [Bootstrap Themes] that looks something like this:

      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/real.jpg" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="What I need to start building."> <figcaption class="figure-caption">What I need to start building.</figcaption> </figure>

      But the [CSS] language is not happy about making 3D things, and artful little digital frescos, so I have to make a few little tools.

      To celebrate this little programming milestone I temporarily added the "Heavy Metal" [Designer] Preset to all boxes on CATPEA.

      I am still working on [Designer] I found some graphic artifacts with yesterday's approach, now I am creating the 3D raised effect with Drop Shadows, rather than inner shadows.

      This means that I can color the inside of the box with a bit more creativity.

      [Designer] is still in early stages, I have to add profile support, probably restructure the flow control as well. But it will forever solve the problem of 3D raised boxes in themes.

      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/box1.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Three Shadows to Simulate Surface"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Three Shadows to Simulate Surface</figcaption> </figure>

      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/box2.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Close Up"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Close Up</figcaption> </figure>

      And here is what is actually going on. This show the places where colors are placed to give a 3D effect.

      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/box3.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Color Revelation"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Color Revelation</figcaption> </figure>
      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/box4.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Color Revelation"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Color Revelation</figcaption> </figure>

      Orange is where the highlight color lives.

      Red, Green, Blue, are combined together to create smooth surface that created the 3D effect.

      Yellow is the subtle Drop Shadow that is cast on the page background.

      I have managed to create a little tool named [Designer], mostly for Desktops. The tool sets only three things, the top highlight, the bottom shade, a drop shadow that it casts on the background.
      Our sample image has more shadows, more blending, it is precise with its colors, and my tool can do that as well, and without making the UI much more complex.

      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/real.jpg" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Real Design"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Real Design</figcaption> </figure>

      I am only focusing on the box around the components, so in this case it is the thing that makes the Audio Player look 3D, like it has a height.

      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/real2.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Real Design"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Real Design</figcaption> </figure>

      From what my eyes can see here, he set the top highlight to be 1 pixel, bottom shade about 6, and he is using a subtle 4 pixel drop shadow. Alone, these things are almost imperceptible,
      together, they create a convincing 3D effect.

      I believe this is a design by [Creative Mints] because I noticed [something similar].

      And right now, I don't have any particular design in mind. I am just focusing on creating a tool that gives a convincing 3D effect, in a language called CSS. CSS is not meant for this, but applying a couple of tricks here and there, can actually work, and efficiently, and it would be accepted by the [Bootstrap] developers as OK. I did play with this tool for a few minutes, and it needs another layer of shade, to make the bottom border more pronounced, other than that it is about done.

      Creating [serserge] was in deed a good idea, the newest thing about it, is that it gives me the ability to query [Bootstrap] source-code for things like: "Hey! which things in the source-code have a background?"
      Armed with this information I can mark components and their pieces for cloning (making my own copy) and then editing.

      Now, the next step is DESIGN. The [image up top] (click to zoom) is a really good example of what design is... design makes you look.

      Design is Pleasant.

      Design, like a Remix of a Song, changes as not to bore.

      I am going to make a new tool, here for catpea where I study certain approaches to creating artistic accents.

      I have previously experimented with this by having created [skins], [neumorphism], [fantasy-gui], [synthwave] and [color-schemes]. For this first one I'll keep things even simpler.

        I continue adapting my strategy for approaching automated [Bootstrap] processing. I created a program that creates a little overview of thier code for me, my program is able to understand all of their code now.

        <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/overview.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Bootstrap Code Overview"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Bootstrap Code Overview</figcaption> </figure>

        Overall, they come in with just about 5700 statements, talking about color, and text padding, and and little quirks and tricks. Looking over their work, I realized, If I touch any of this code they will hate me, with a passion.

        If I am to get accepted into [Bootstrap Themes]

        I can't automatically process their things, I have to make copies.

        For example: the Navbar on top of this web page is a lot of work, a lot of balancing and tweaking, and option adding.

        The only way I can touch it, is by making a copy, calling it SuperNavbar. And here, in the SuperNavbar, I can strip down colors, and apply my magical animations, and bits, and things.

        Well, that's progress. Progress with a bonus. Because at any point users can fall back on the original Navbar, and there is a couple ways to do that even. Anymore, work must arise from my Static Code Analysis here, from my little tools.

        At this point the Greatest Secret in Good Programming is kicking in: Rather than doing what I think I should do. I should do what is possible to do, with a hefty dose of code integrity, and program stability.

        More than that, my theme, my designs, should apply to many versions of Bootstrap, many of the [past releases] - that's just good programming.

        Even if I stick to the v4.x branch (which is most reasonable), I will need to release 5 of 6 versions of my theme, and then maybe three more after that.

        I am very well aware, what a punch in the stomach all this is to the designers. The stuff that I am working on here, is really uncomfortable for most Designers. They don't want to process abstract syntax trees, or learn programming even.

        Also, a little twinkle of a business perspective is bubbling up here. Automated processing means bug free product, fast upgrades, fast support.

        But still, I am not sure what I will do to automate Design, once I do have SuperNavbar, presumably with all colors removed, and I make some classes like I have in [THEME] right now, to apply color to things, an interactive color, that supports mult-color-websites and multiple dark themes.
        Vary some fonts, and padding, and margins. I am still stuck with, what is basically... a [basic theme].


        <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/basic.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Basic Theme"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Basic Theme</figcaption> </figure>


        I still have to come up with a Robotic Artist, that actually does [real design].


        <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/real.jpg" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Real Design"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Real Design</figcaption> </figure>


        But... I think I know how to do that. You know how Megaman can [inherit weapons from their enemies by touch].


        <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/megaman.jpg" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="Inherit Design"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Design Inheritance</figcaption> </figure>


        I think I can make some basic designs like beautifully styled boxes, and then AIM THEM AT SuperNavbar and SuperCard, and fire.

        SuperNavbar would then inherit properties of those Artistic Designs, background skin, inner shadow, blend gradients. Art is actually easy. I don't think anyone should ever sit down to decorating Navbars, the decorations must be carbon copied from something simpler, and certainly more reusable. THis way multiple components can be decorated at once.

        Wow, it is 2PM already. I am thinking about a lot of my programming projects at once, this coloring adventure is just relaxations.

      <p>Ewwwwwww! I switched from [node-sass] to [sass], node-sass got old, I guess.</p>
      I wasn't really paying too much attention to SASS (a UI programming language) because I think CSS should be shaped with JS, as these are native browser <p>technologies. But since [Bootstrap] is forcing me into [sass], I might as well make use of the language, and... I guess its functions as well.</p>

      <p>Since this is a new addition to the system, there is both a learning curve, and bugs.</p>
      <p>So I've been trying to execute color.adjust(#6b717f, $red: 15); these are the big fancy new functions, but I've been getting errors for days.</p>

      <p>Well, now that I switched to [sass] (from node-sass) there were changes, but I still got an error.</p>
      <p>It turns out they have a new module system, and before I make use of the color function I have to execute @use 'sass:color'; on top of the program file.</p>

      <p>That's how it is done in all programming languages, but since I upgraded, I had to learn few new things about the new version of the language.</p>

      <p>Now, this does not mean that I approve of the existence of the [SASS Programming Language] in my code. But it is OK.</p>

      As the first, thing here, I created a custom function, this is written in JavaScript, and it is integrated with SASS. The function measures readability between a background color and a foreground color, and it is interesting... Because even though everyone says "if readability is more than 4.5 you are peachy",</p>

      <p>When working with themes, when kind of knowing colors, the 4.5 threshold can be lowered down to 1.5 even.</p>

      <p>The big deal here is being able to say, keep darkening/lightening that color until it passes the readability test.</p>

      <p>Here is an image of a recent test of using my [wcag-contrast](foreground, background) function until a color is readable.</p>

      <p>Note how text in the first column it not readable as the background and text-color converge in the middle.</p>
      <p>And now look at the second column, where SMART coloring is taking place.</p>

      <p>I know it is still dark, I kept the color change threshold very low on purpose, to make the overall UI graphics nice. The point is that the text is keeping up with the background, it is keeping juuuuuuust a wee bit above, un-readability.</p>


      <figure class="figure"> <img src="research/smart-color.png" class="figure-img w-100 rounded" alt="GUI Ideas"> <figcaption class="figure-caption">Automatic Coloring</figcaption> </figure>

      <p>As a side-note, programming-wise this is not really impressive, it is like 5 lines of code, so pro-programmers would yawn at this,
      but it is a big deal for me, because I am getting really precise and delicate control over colors in my Dark Theme here, that it is only 5 lines of code, is great for me, I can just type in a bit of code and be done with worrying about color readability for some UI component or button/label combo. I like this. And I like being given the opportunity to ponder if I want something to grow brighter (like a label on a button) or darker, like in the case of a number-label on a table of data (like a row number in Excel). </p>

        [CATPEA DAW] is now a Desktop Application, Mobile Devices are too slow for making music, this is a new program with new stuff in it, I won't be changing anything else, I like having all these random gadgets here.
        </p>

      <p>
        And it is still too early to know if [CATPEA DAW] can work, there is no guarantee that what I am doing can actually result in a functional program. I went out of my way to create a Data Structure Driven program with minimal data manipulation functions embedded in the UI only.
      </p>

      <p>
        A lot of programmers would hate this, the best of them would want me to create well named ACTIONS like 'selectTrack' or 'enableNote' but that just adds to the weight of the program, it destroys it.
        Programs that are WRITTEN-OUT like the best of these programmers want are BLOATED, HUGE, almost broken by design.
      </p>

      <p>
       And what I am creating is a program that exploits only that which is possible, and no more. I am creating a self editing data structure with self-updating graphics. If this works out, I'll be able to create programs without programming. It would be more like data shaping and expressing, and not programming.
       It would beat the heck out of other applications. There is no code here, there is nothing to break.
      </p>

      <p>
      The trade-off is that a program like this can't receive specific features, UNLESS, they are possible as dictated by the data-structure and its shaping.
      </p>

       <p>
       If this was a project for a company, for a client and client requested a feature incompatible with the tree, one would have to say "That, is not possible". To rewrite a program like this in standard code with Data Flows, Functions, Actions, Plugins, and such would take years.
       </p>

       <p>
       Isn't this interesting? &middot; Alas, let us first see if I can have all I need to make music withut needing functions.

Already I am thinking that I should not use colors, but rather transparent shadows, so whatever color is in the background the drawer will inherit it automatically. [Bootstrap] creates flat/raised things, and my additions may end up being graphically sunken. Plus, [Bootstrap] creates structure, and I use it for layout and containers. They don't really create content that is specific for some purpose (like my DAW), they limit themselves to general purpose things. They do sell themes, and if I ever completed this project, they may accept mine into their store. I have much more to learn, and I still have to get used to their way of doing things.`
