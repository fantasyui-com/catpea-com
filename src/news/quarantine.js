          <p class="mb-2">the promised day of rhyme a plenty.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">I am sitting here with my salad,</p>
          <p class="mb-2">expecting to write world's littlest ballad.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">I waited until the conclusion of day,</p>
          <p class="mb-2">to see with what rhymes that may pay.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Alas, twenty just about rhymes with plenty,</p>
          <p class="mb-2">it rhymes as good as yeti and orange.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">On the other hand Twenty One,</p>
          <p class="mb-2">rhymes with all under the sun.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">I am sitting here smacking my lips,</p>
          <p class="mb-2">Counting down 90 days to Penumbral Eclipse.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">I made little sausages to add to my salad,</p>
          <p class="mb-2">I added really spicy dressing to spruce up my ballad.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">As I grilled the little things, I remembered that same smell,</p>

          <p class="mb-0">But the squirrels, again, they act so weird,</p>
          <p class="mb-0">smart little kitties worried that everyone disappeared.</p>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>

          <p class="mb-0">Speaking of weird, programming is such a fun game,</p>
          <p class="mb-0">I am convinced it is unhealthy, but I think that's a shame.</p>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>

          <p class="mb-0">My computer programs kept me company since I was nine,</p>
          <p class="mb-0">I was so little, and already learning the command line.</p>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>

          <p class="mb-0">Alas, the time doth fly,</p>
          <p class="mb-0">as we grow older we must take to the sky.</p>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>

          <p class="mb-0">We have to learn beyond what is at our fingertips,</p>
          <p class="mb-0">and set aims for all those leaderships.</p>
          <div>&nbsp;</div>

          <p class="mb-0">We should pamper our talents, can't leave them behind,</p>

      I ordered some trailmix from the internet,
      mailman dropped it off by the door and all the local Squirrels I\'ve been feeding came over,
      ripped the box open, and ate it. How rude, I probably shoudn\'t have been feeding them all this time.

The area that opens up below when user clicks a line number will be used for sound synthesis configuration that could be as many as 10 dropdowns. I don\'t like horizontal scrolling, this is what this test is about. But there is something wrong with Vertical Scrolling, like here in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdSslkrN1kk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mod Trackers</a>, it just feels too awkward to compose a song downwards. On the other hand I don\'t want to recreate the [Ableton] UI, editing music this way is too slow. I\'ll probably keep creating these little UI widgets, but begin connecting them together under a common beat. This way the end result is a dashboard of easy to use musical instruments, and probably some fat <span class="shake shake-force">${octicons.squirrel.toSVG()}squirrels.`

A tiny collection will do, because we have the the synthesizer taking care of everything else. I added some Hip sounds to the THE WARRIOR Album Single and it does sound very well.

When a visitor visits, the pre-ran (pre-generated static version) will then be upgraded to a real version, and replaced by now running live version. It is the correct technology, and it didn\'t get me, but it does take a moment to figure out when a bug jumps out of nowhere.'

    I am for the first time in forever connecting virtual synthesizers through a <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/Reverb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reverb Convolver</a>.
    This reshapes the Synthesized Sounds, the synthesizer waveform, into a more realistic sounding instrument. Reverb just about does it, if Commodore 64 came with a decent reverb it would sound amazing, nothing like chiptunes.
    I have gotten used to breaking up my Generative Music into movements, and the initial song comes with 24 measures, where evey eight measures I do something interesting with the higher pitched instruments.
    For the most part I fell like using A Basic <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arpeggiator</a> for everything, I am yet to test it with real world sound samples (digital sound recordings as opposed to synthesizer based sounds.)`
