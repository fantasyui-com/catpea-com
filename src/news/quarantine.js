    Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Three.

    Days pass by quickly, but as all the clocks tick away,
    we mustn't keep our minds at bay.

    We each have extraordinary powers,
    and we can expand our knowledge,
    in just a few hours.

    All it takes is a video lecture,
    or maybe an audio-book,
    you don't even have to look.

    Hours add up, day by day,
    building, a new passageway.
    - It is knowledge that sets us free.

    And our inheritance from great beings,
    is the key.

    We mustn't forget, that everyone needs to learn,
    not merely listen, but break out of their prison,
    and rise to greatness, when theirs is the turn.

    It is within us, that each great being should return,
    it is how the world grows, it is how you get your turn.

    So, rise to their height, inherit their might,
    shine the brightest of light,
    yours is the future, yours is the fight.

    Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Two,
    I thought about my bicycle, my trail,
    the morning dew.

    When there is no gym,
    I get up real early,
    and ride on through,

    It is magical out there,
    seeing the world from the other side,
    people stuck in traffic,
    and here I ride.

    I discovered modern architecture
    of the highway underpass,
    little woodland parks,
    endless fields of grass.

    Five miles out,
    there lives an angry goose,

    at seven miles,
    in deep summer, angry 'squitoes on the loose,

    Ten miles out,
    there is a ninety degree turn,
    and emptiness follows,
    nothing but deep green fern.

    Fifteen miles out,
    a whole new city,
    two new parks,
    and the road gets gritty.

    At twenty miles,
    the real adventure starts,
    you better have water,
    and some street smarts.

    And if you keep going forward,
    you'll arrive on a pier at Lake Erie.

    At first you'll feel pretty weary,
    until you realize you're 30 miles from your bed,
    at which point things will get pretty mad.

    Hope you have trailmix.
    Cause you're gonna need it.
    To find you way back.
    and keep pushing those pedals.

    It will get dark soon,
    but upon your return,
    you'll fall into your comfy bed,
    with a long, dramatic swoon,

    Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty One,
    I've been programming all day, but now I am done.

    I coded colors, design, music, a whole ballad,
    but now my mind has fixed its aims on a salad.

    I've been trying to invent one that tastes really nice,
    one that someone could even eat twice.

    And I did! as I always do,
    Just add Strawberry Jam, a dollop or two.

    No need for dressing,
    it tastes like a blessing!

    Just squirt some jam,
    mix it up and Bam!

    Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty,
    I've been fixing bugs all day, and I feel dirty.

    Now, that I fixed them all,
    I must admit, I had a ball.

    But, computers are slow,
    My CPU is slower than a BBQ.

    I tried to build a rhyming dictionary,
    but it came out as an 8 megabyte webpage,
    and nearly erased the internet.

    In computers, everything is really bad,
    but this never makes me sad, I am glad.

    And now,
    I took a shower,
    and smell great,
    my only wish,
    is that I already ate.

    Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Nine,
    I spent the day doing Graphic Design.

    Making art and poetry is quite fun,
    though with the aid of computers, easily overdone.

    I've been doing this for so long, that I've learned,
    that, on computers, brevity is the Mother of Invention.

    I am a huge fan, of the UNIX command line,
    of the various little ways to get things done.

    Graphic design, takes a different path,
    it takes a while to switch between the two.

    Programming languages, is where I spend most of my time,
    its an in-between world, betwixt the two.

    I've been programming Music and Art,
    It turned out not to be that hard.

    At the end of the day, what matters is the Masterpiece,
    it matters not if it comes from Computers, Music or Art,

    So as long as you finish what you start, and use your hart,
    you are an Artist, and what you make, is Art.

          Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Eight,
          It's evening and it's late,

          Time for another poetic update,
          I sit here, and yet again, cogitate.

          It actually feels pretty great,
          I look forward to my little poetry date.

          And I always try to really concentrate,
          turn everything off and meditate.

          Let all those rhymes percolate.
          Let all those words decorate.

          Poetry is a universe in self,
          it won't always let you write what you are trying say.

          I just want to rhyme something funny,
          write about weather or how its sunny.

          But each poem has a mind of its own,
          each one is a kind of a milestone.

          There is a thousand ways to get to the end,
          but it all depends if the message is,
          what you intend.

          Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Seven,
          Ohh, I waited to write until eleven.

          It seems late at night,
          but this is when my rhymes take flight.

          I admit, I am ready for bed,
          but I am just going to sit here, instead,
          and wait for my poem to go ahead.

          Nuh uhh, rhyming is not always easy,
          sometimes you just got to to wait, and take it easy.

          Wait for the prime rhyme,
          to top of your mind... climb.

          And then finally, when you get there,
          you sit, read, and stare,
          feeling like the poem, is a little bare.

          But what can you do? It's late at night,
          and you are not really feeling very bright.

          But you still have to write,
          so that's quite all right.

          This is how I begin my night,
          I write.

          I don't even know how long ago it was,
          so long ago, I forgot the cause.

          I own two metal chopsticks,
          and they work as good as fingers.

          I use them to eat my salads,
          to scoop out Jelly and Peanut Butter,
          I kid you not, I even use them as a little cutter.

          A dull stick is just fine to turn a sausage in two.
          And of course, I stir many a tea, or protein brew.

          I do not miss the dangerous forks,
          though once, in a blue moon,
          I wish, I owned a spoon.

            Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Five,
            Yesterday, Bernie dropped out.

            I didn't even try to wait, you can't place this much weight.
            And what were we expecting?

            It has always been like this, hit and miss.
            It is time for all, to rise.

            Become a Citizen of The World. In your own hands.
            With your own mind. Seek Knowledge and Triumph.

            Let the name of this New Nation be, Earth,
            May the Citizen be called, a Human.

            The power is in your hands, so near,
            rooted in every audio-book you can hear.

            And you have to lean to rise,
            you can't near the skies,
            without your eyes!

            When you have learned enough, you have to turn around and teach.
            Yell from your mountain, scream, dance and preach.

            The promise of Freedom, Reason, and Peace,
            is in our hands, it is our Masterpiece.

            Education is [fun] it only ever seems hard,
            because one is trying to learn too much in too little time.

            The only way we can fully learn,
            is by inheriting knowledge from World's most beloved Heroes.

            This inheritance begins by following in their footstep, first;
            and continues, when we break away to resume where they left off.

            Rise, rise to the mountains before you.
            The only way,
            is to go up,
            to grow up,
            to grow all the way up,
            until we each become a Great Being.

            Same as those before us,
            same as those that are sure to rise.

            Open Your Eyes.
            The Time is Always Now.

            I am dressed, I am wearing my favorite workout clothes,
            I stretched left and right, and fluffed up my pillows.

            For tonight, I prepared, a Bill Bryson Auidobook I adore,
            Even though I am already so sleepy that I could snore.

            I will listen about the [History of the World],
            about all the mysterious things and places we explored.

            This is how I go to sleep every night,
            the book will slowly play... until daylight.

            I learned so much from online lectures and audio books,
            that these days, I can focus on my good looks.

            Oh, how I miss working out at the gym,
            but I am still working hard to be slim.

            Let us all be of good cheer,

The area that opens up below when user clicks a line number will be used for sound synthesis configuration that could be as many as 10 dropdowns. I don\'t like horizontal scrolling, this is what this test is about. But there is something wrong with Vertical Scrolling, like here in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdSslkrN1kk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mod Trackers</a>, it just feels too awkward to compose a song downwards. On the other hand I don\'t want to recreate the [Ableton] UI, editing music this way is too slow. I\'ll probably keep creating these little UI widgets, but begin connecting them together under a common beat. This way the end result is a dashboard of easy to use musical instruments, and probably some fat <span class="shake shake-force">${octicons.squirrel.toSVG()}</span> squirrels.`

When a visitor visits, the pre-ran (pre-generated static version) will then be upgraded to a real version, and replaced by now running live version. It is the correct technology, and it didn\'t get me, but it does take a moment to figure out when a bug jumps out of nowhere.'

    I am for the first time in forever connecting virtual synthesizers through a <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/docs/13.8.25/Reverb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reverb Convolver</a>.
    This reshapes the Synthesized Sounds, the synthesizer waveform, into a more realistic sounding instrument. Reverb just about does it, if Commodore 64 came with a decent reverb it would sound amazing, nothing like chiptunes.
    I have gotten used to breaking up my Generative Music into movements, and the initial song comes with 24 measures, where evey eight measures I do something interesting with the higher pitched instruments.
    For the most part I fell like using A Basic <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Arpeggiator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Arpeggiator</a> for everything, I am yet to test it with real world sound samples (digital sound recordings as opposed to synthesizer based sounds.)`
