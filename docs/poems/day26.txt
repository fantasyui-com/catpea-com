Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Twenty Six,
I eat with metal chopsticks.

I stooped using forks,
to munch my porks.

I don't even know how long ago it was,
so long ago, I forgot the cause.

I own two metal chopsticks,
and they work as good as fingers.

I use them to eat my salads,
to scoop out Jelly and and Peanut Butter,
I kid you not, I even use them as a little cutter.

A dull stick is just fine to turn a sausage in two.
And of course, I stir many a tea, or protein brew.

I do not miss the dangerous forks,
though once - in a blue moon,
I wish, I owned a spoon.
