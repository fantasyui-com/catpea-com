Captain's Log, Quarantine, Day Thirty Three.

Rise to The Greatness

Days pass by quickly, but as all the clocks tick away,
we mustn't keep our minds at bay.

We each have extraordinary powers,
and we can expand our knowledge,
in just a few hours.

All it takes is a video lecture,
or maybe an audio-book,
you don't even have to look.

Hours add up, day by day,
building, a new passageway.
- It is knowledge that sets us free.

And our inheritance from great beings,
is the key.

We mustn't forget, that everyone needs to learn,
not merely listen, but break out of their prison,
and rise to greatness, when theirs is the turn.

It is within us, that each great being should return,
it is how the world grows, it is how you get your turn.

So, rise to their height, inherit their might,
shine the brightest of light,
yours is the future, yours is the fight.
