I am learning to make components for [Bootstrap] this has been a hobby of mine for many years now. It feels nice to be making progress here.

The <a href="https://github.com/fantasyui-com/catpea-com/tree/master/src/style/drawer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text-warning">drawer page</a> shows examples of how to use the Drawer, that language is called HTML. [Bootstrap] developers would frown on my work thus far because the drawer component can almost be made in another way, they actually have similar things. But I am thinking about creating components for a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Digital+Audio+Workstation&tbm=isch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text-warning">Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)</a> like [Ableton], right now the drawer is not impressive, but it will evolve beyond what Bootstrap can do. Already I am thinking that I should not use colors, but rather transparent shadows, so whatever color is in the background the drawer will inherit it automatically. [Bootstrap] creates flat/raised things, and my additions may end up being graphically sunken. Plus, [Bootstrap] creates structure, and I use it for layout and containers. They don\'t really create content that is specific for some purpose (like my DAW), they limit themselves to general purpose things. They do sell themes, and if I ever completed this project, they may accept mine into their store.
